# Distributed and Concurrent Programming Course

## Module 1 - Real-Time Systems

### T1
A simple sense-think-act system using an Arduino board and a soil moisture sensor (SEN0114).
Built-in LED activates if plant needs water. 

### T2
Counter system using push button and 7-segment display. Button push increments value on the display. 
Uses interrupts instead of putting button code in loop function.

### T3
Same system as T2 but adding an additional button and interrupt. New button decreases counter. 

### T4
Same system as T3 but with a third button. Uses PIN Change Interrupts PCINT library to add more than the 2 default interrupts available. Third button increments counter by 2.
Internal interupt in the form of a timer also implemented. Timer fires every 10 seconds, built-in lED flashes and counter resets to zero.
